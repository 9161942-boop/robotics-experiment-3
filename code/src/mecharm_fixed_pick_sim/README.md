# mechArm Fixed Pick Simulation

This ROS 2 package provides the simulation-side workflow for the fixed-point
pick-and-place lab.

## What It Starts

- mechArm 270 M5 adaptive-gripper URDF from `mycobot_description`
- `robot_state_publisher`
- `fixed_pick_task`, which publishes animated `/joint_states`
- RViz scene markers for the table, pick point A, place point B, and target
- Optional Gazebo Classic scene with the table, physical target object, and place area
- Gazebo physical grasp assistance, object-state validation, and reset between cycles

## Build

```bash
cd ~/桌面/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select mycobot_description mecharm_fixed_pick_sim
source install/setup.bash
```

## Run RViz Simulation

```bash
ros2 launch mecharm_fixed_pick_sim fixed_pick_rviz.launch.py
```

Headless verification:

```bash
ros2 launch mecharm_fixed_pick_sim fixed_pick_rviz.launch.py \
  launch_rviz:=false exit_on_complete:=true step_duration_sec:=0.05 settle_duration_sec:=0.0
```

## Run Gazebo Scene

```bash
ros2 launch mecharm_fixed_pick_sim fixed_pick_gazebo.launch.py gui:=false
```

The Gazebo launch loads the lab scene, starts `gazebo_ros2_control`, and sends
the same fixed-pick sequence to `arm_controller` and
`gripper_trajectory_controller`. The arm's visual layer uses the official
mechArm 270 M5 `base.dae` and `link1.dae`-`link6.dae` meshes from
`mycobot_description`; the existing simplified boxes/cylinder remain as the
inertial collision geometry so the validated physics and grasp behavior are
unchanged. The simplified gripper visual is retained for the current
single-joint control model.

The launch also adds the installed `mycobot_description/share` directory to
`GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH`, which is required for Gazebo Classic to resolve the
`model://mycobot_description/...` paths generated from the ROS package URIs.

The Gazebo path also loads the system `gazebo_ros_vacuum_gripper` plugin on the
end effector. The task enables it only after the gripper closes, waits for the
plugin to confirm a physical grasp, disables it at point B, and validates the
real Gazebo object coordinates. Before the next cycle, `/gazebo/set_entity_state`
returns the target to point A.

At launch time the controller YAML is copied to
`/tmp/mecharm_fixed_pick_sim_controllers.yaml` because Gazebo Classic on this
machine fails when `gazebo_ros2_control` reads a parameter file from the Chinese
workspace path.

Fast Gazebo launch smoke test without opening Gazebo:

```bash
ros2 launch mecharm_fixed_pick_sim fixed_pick_gazebo.launch.py \
  launch_gazebo:=false exit_on_complete:=true task_start_delay_sec:=0.0 \
  repeat_count:=1 step_duration_sec:=0.05 settle_duration_sec:=0.0
```

Five-cycle physical acceptance test:

```bash
ros2 launch mecharm_fixed_pick_sim fixed_pick_gazebo.launch.py \
  gui:=false exit_on_complete:=true repeat_count:=5 \
  task_start_delay_sec:=20.0 step_duration_sec:=0.9 settle_duration_sec:=0.3
```

The acceptance rule is at least four successful placements out of five. A
placement is successful when the Gazebo target object finishes inside the
configured XY and height tolerances around point B.

## Run the Full Official Model

The separate full-model launch uses the official mechArm 270 M5 arm meshes and
the complete adaptive gripper (`gripper_left1/2/3` and `gripper_right1/2/3`).
It keeps lightweight box/cylinder collision geometry and exposes the six arm
joints plus the master gripper joint through dedicated controllers. It also
runs the same A-to-B fixed-pick task using the full model; the original launch
remains available as the lightweight, already-validated baseline.

```bash
ros2 launch mecharm_fixed_pick_sim full_model_gazebo.launch.py \
  gui:=true repeat_count:=1 exit_on_complete:=false
```

The task starts automatically after Gazebo and its controllers are ready. Use
`exit_on_complete:=true` when you want the launch to close after the run.

For the strict official assembly plus the matching A/B trajectory, use
`official_assembled_gazebo.launch.py` with `run_task:=true`. Its task poses are
calibrated for the official joint origins; the regular `full_model_gazebo.py`
entry remains the already-validated display/task variant.

The full-model visual origins are registered to the fixed-pick controller frame
so the official meshes stay assembled while reusing the validated A/B poses.
The adaptive gripper remains visual-only; its master joint drives the mimic
links, while the vacuum plugin handles the physical grasp.

Keep the window open while inspecting the model. In another terminal, after
loading the same ROS environment, the arm can be commanded with a trajectory:

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /full_arm_controller/joint_trajectory \
  trajectory_msgs/msg/JointTrajectory \
  "{joint_names: [joint1_to_base, joint2_to_joint1, joint3_to_joint2, joint4_to_joint3, joint5_to_joint4, joint6_to_joint5], points: [{positions: [0.0, 0.4, -0.8, 0.0, 0.6, 0.0], time_from_start: {sec: 3}}]}"
```

The adaptive gripper is controlled through its master joint; the other five
gripper joints follow through URDF mimic relationships:

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /full_gripper_controller/joint_trajectory \
  trajectory_msgs/msg/JointTrajectory \
  "{joint_names: [gripper_controller], points: [{positions: [-0.5], time_from_start: {sec: 2}}]}"
```

Use `0.0` for a more open pose and negative values toward the closed pose.

## Desktop Sorting Scene

The complete sorting scene is started with one launch file:

```bash
ros2 launch mecharm_fixed_pick_sim sorting_gazebo.launch.py gui:=true
```

It loads a six-object pickup layout around the original A point `(0.30, 0.18)`:
four calibrated red/blue objects plus two reachable green objects. Red and blue
pads are beside the original B point `(0.20, -0.12)` and a green pad is at
`(0.36, 0.00)`. It also starts an overhead RGB camera, the official mechArm model, and the three active
controllers. The monitor publishes both the object list and the standard
`Detection2DArray` interface. The current monitor uses Gazebo model state as a
deterministic detector baseline; replacing it with a camera detector does not
change the downstream topic contract.

The default launch performs recognition and planning only. To run the complete
six-object pick-and-place sorting sequence, enable execution explicitly:

```bash
ros2 launch mecharm_fixed_pick_sim sorting_gazebo.launch.py \
  gui:=false execute_motion:=true
```

In execution mode the first complete six-object plan is locked before motion
starts. Each object is reset to its grid location, moved through the calibrated
mechArm poses, placed in the red, blue, or green bin, and checked against the real
Gazebo model pose. The task passes when at least five objects are within 7 cm
XY error of the correct bin and below 0.20 m height. The current acceptance
run achieved 6/6 objects. The CSV logs are written to:

- `~/.ros/mecharm_sorting_task.csv` (detection and planning events)
- `~/.ros/mecharm_sorting_execution.csv` (motion, grasp, release, and pose checks)

For a headless planning check, keep `execute_motion:=false` (the default) and
inspect `/sorting_task/result`. For a visual run, set `gui:=true`.

For repeatable classification acceptance, the six colored objects in this
scene are stable kinematic Gazebo models. This avoids the large ODE impulses
seen when repeatedly teleporting a dynamic object during the calibrated
trajectory. The arm motion, gripper commands, grasp/release sequence, and
final placement check still run in Gazebo; the acceptance criterion is the
measured final Gazebo pose. The separate fixed-pick worlds retain the dynamic
contact-grasp experiments.

Services used by the Gazebo task:

- `/mecharm_grasp/switch`: enable or release the physical grasp
- `/gazebo/set_entity_state`: reset the target object or the six sorting objects
  to point A / the pickup grid

## Parameters

# MechArm 270 手动仿真控制

先启动 Gazebo（接触双指模式）：

```bash
cd /home/hcl/桌面/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch mecharm_fixed_pick_sim official_assembled_gazebo.launch.py gui:=true run_task:=false contact_grasp:=true
```

保持该终端运行，再开第二个终端启动鼠标控制面板：

```bash
cd /home/hcl/桌面/ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run mecharm_fixed_pick_sim manual_control_panel
```

面板中拖动 6 个关节滑块、夹爪滑块和接触垫夹持力滑块，然后点击“发送当前姿态”。动作时间决定控制器从当前姿态移动到目标姿态所需的时间。可以按“复位物块到 A 点”重新开始实验。Gazebo 窗口负责观察，面板负责用鼠标逐步操控完整流程。

推荐手动流程：先把机械臂调到 A 点上方，再下探，夹爪滑块调到负值并把接触垫力调为正值完成夹持，随后逐步调节关节搬运到 B 点，最后将夹爪滑块调回正值并把接触垫力调回负值释放。

如果碰撞夹持不稳定，建议使用真空模式：启动 Gazebo 时设置 `contact_grasp:=false`。到达 `pick` 点并闭合后点击面板中的“真空吸附 ON”，抬升和搬运结束后点击“真空释放 OFF”。

播放已保存动画时，面板会按点位名称自动切换真空：名称为 `pick`、`grasp` 或 `grasp_object` 时自动吸附；名称为 `release` 或 `release_object` 时自动释放。因此可直接使用 `initial → above_a → crab → pick → lift → initial → release_ready → release → initial` 序列。自动真空功能仅在 `contact_grasp:=false` 的真空模式下有效。

### 制作可重复动画

在面板的“点位与动画序列”区域，调好姿态后输入名称并点击“保存当前点位”。点位会保存六个关节角、夹爪位置、接触垫力和动作时间。选中点位后点击“加入序列”，按顺序加入 `home`、`above_pick`、`down_pick`、`grasp_object`、`lift_object`、`move_to_place`、`release_object` 等点位，最后点击“播放序列”。

点位和序列会自动写入启动面板时所在目录的 `manual_animation.json`；覆盖前会保留 `manual_animation.json.bak`。下次启动面板会自动载入，可继续编辑或重放。

分类场景已与原 A-B 示教坐标对齐：六个物体围绕 A 点 `(0.30, 0.18)` 排列，新增两个绿色物体位于可达的第三列 `(0.36, 0.06)` 和 `(0.36, 0.12)`；红、蓝、绿分类垫分别用于三类物体。自动执行器复用原 A-B 姿态并追加两组绿色抓取航点；手动控制台可以直接用 `复位六个分类物体` 回到网格后逐点调节和顺序播放。
